# Christmas SPaRCs Cyber Quiz

A festive, in-browser cyber security quiz built for team meetings. Add team names, answer together, reveal explanations after everyone has picked, and celebrate the top three on a podium.

## Getting started
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build tools required) or serve locally, e.g. `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. Add team names, start the quiz, and let each team choose an answer for every question.
3. Explanations appear after all teams have responded, and scores automatically roll into the 1st/2nd/3rd place podium at the end.
